Hello Evaluator!

Here's my task for the Brydge Full-Stack Developer Application.

## Financial Dashboard
I was tasked with developing a feature for your fintech platform, allowing users to craft, tailor, and oversee budget categories, enhancing financial planning. This led me to develop an intuitive and visually pleasing dashboard where users have easy access to various actions like creating a budget category, modifying and deleting it at a glance. Here users can view their spending history and allocate funds to different budget categories. Upon signing up, you have access to a million naira to test the application.

### Stack
For this task, I used Node.js, Typescript, Prisma and Supabase to build the business logic. For the frontend, I utilised, Typescript, Next.js and TailwindCss too build a responsive and intuitive user interface.

### Conclusion
This task was a challenging one because I had no previous experience with Prisma ORM being a non-relational database developer. I *delved* into the internet and was able to get a grasp of the fundamental concepts enabling me to build out the application withtin the timeframe I was given. I enjoyed working on this project and out of my comfort zone, because it has helped me encounter relational databases as well as enjoy working with them thanks to the Prisma ORM.
